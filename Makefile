# The shell this module runs in declares entries with the `gfx` module, and
# only the runtime fork has it (chicago-desktop/runtime, a build from its
# releases, v0.3.40a-chicago.2 or newer — the one that also resolves the
# shell from its GitHub repository by tag): the release `wippy` does not
# load such a module at all ("node with ID … not found"). Point WIPPY at
# the fork's binary:
#
#   make test WIPPY=~/src/runtime/dist/wippy-linux-amd64
WIPPY ?= /home/butschster/repos/wippy/runtime/dist/wippy-linux-amd64

# The shell declares its own terminal.host, and the CLI then refuses to pick
# one by itself; the suites run on the application's ordinary host.
TEST_HOST := wippy.terminal:host

# Late `local`s first — a local read above its declaration is a global, that
# is nil, with no error; `wippy lint` does not see this at all.
